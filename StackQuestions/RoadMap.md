# StackQuestions - Road Map

This project is currently fairly barebones. Here are some basic improvements that could be made. 
1. Scoring - A scoring function would be a nice addtional to allow users to test them selves. 
2. Score Board - A scoreboard for the solution would be nice for people to compare to other users.  This would require a bit more of a back end and require some data storage. 
3. Categories - Being able to pull questions by a specific category would be a really nice addtion.
